## Completion

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/nogully/palette-picker/blob/1a10a1cf6b00e38c9cf7c9905c7ccb0aec1571bf/public/js/scripts.js#L27-L38)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I liked using .toArray() with jQuery to create an array of elements to iterate through

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/nogully/palette-picker/blob/1a10a1cf6b00e38c9cf7c9905c7ccb0aec1571bf/public/js/scripts.js#L84-L107)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
I tried to use the server to check the database for a given project name and to generate an error if that name already existed, but I ran out of time to make that work.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it
[palette image](https://goo.gl/images/BmP8qB) 
I used a wood grain background because I thought it evoked the idea of an artist's palette and paints. 

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
I would have liked to have had more time to create better error handling and sad path cases.
